  // start with strings, numbers and booleans

// Let's say we have an array
const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

// and we want to make a copy of it.
const team = players

console.log(players, team)

// You might think we can just do something like this:
team[3] = 'Lux'
// however what happens when we update that array?

// now here is the problem!

// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
const team2 = players.slice()
const team3 = [].concat(players)
const team4 = [...players]
const team5 = Array.from(players)
team4[3] = 'woop pp'
console.log(team2)
// one way

// or create a new array and concat the old one in

// or use the new ES6 Spread

// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

// with Objects
const person = {
  name: 'Rob',
  age: 29
}

// and think we make a copy:

// const captain = person
// captain.number = 99

// how do we take a copy instead?
const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 20 })
console.log(cap2)
// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
const cap3 = { ...person }
// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
const rob = {
  name: 'rob',
